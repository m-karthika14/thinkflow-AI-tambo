/*
  LocalThinkflowDummy.tsx
  -----------------------
  This file previously implemented a local demo/home UI used for manual testing.
  The component is not needed anymore and has been commented out per request.

  If you need to restore it, the original implementation lived here and provided
  a small interactive area with a query input, intent buttons (EXPLORE / UNDERSTAND / DECIDE / ACT),
  a grid of sample cards, a focus modal and simple renderers for each intent.

  Keeping a minimal no-op component exported so imports won't break other files.

  return null;
